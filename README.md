Summary:
This is the update Portfolio project taking in consideration the additional skills we have acquired since the first iteration.  

Components:
This is a responsive single page application that utilizes Foundation CSS and HTML code. No JavaScript or jQuery were used.  The page uses a navigation menu with bookmarks to each section on the site.  Page sections include an About me, Web Development Portfolio, Contact Me and a copyright footer.  

Sections:
The About Me section contains a two-paragraph biography and a personal photo. 
The Web Development Section includes four apps, one group project and individual apps.  Each app sub-section contains a screenshot with a hot link to the deployed app, app description, link to the corresponding GitHub repository and link to the deployed app. 
The Contact Me section includes icons and links to email, LinkedIn Profile, GitHub repository and resume in PDF format.  I chose not to share my real phone number for obvious privacy reasons, but included a phone icon and a dummy phone number.  
The footer section contains generic copyright disclaimer.
